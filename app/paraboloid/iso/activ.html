<li> During  IAGA-IASPEI Joint Assembly  in Hanoi, Vietnam (August, 2001) it was approved that the
 evaluation of the

It was decided to create 
the scientific subcommittee of the Division V Working Group 3  of International Association
Geomagnetism and Aeronomy  for the examination of the ISO 
magnetospheric model. Dr. I. Alexeev (head of the MSU group elaborating the
paraboloid model) is working now within this subcommittee.</li>

5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Contacts with IAGA</h3>
<!--
<p>
In response to the request from the International Organization for
Standardization  ISO/TC20/SC14/WG4 committee on the 'Space Environment
(Natural and Artificial)' the  Division V and Working Group 3 of
International Association for Geomagnetism and  Aeronomy (IAGA) carried
out an assessment of the need for and relevance of a 'standard 
magnetospheric model' within the community of magnetospheric scientists.
Based on the 5  responses of modellers, the negative, in general,
attitude about the magnetospheric magnetic  field standard elaboration
was made. 

<p>
The main reason against the magnetospheric field standard  elaboration
connected with proposition that it will restrict the future development of the 
magnetospheric models and does not give the possibility to create any
alternative models.  The main recommendation from IAGA representatives is to
reconsider the current ISO  approach to magnetospheric field model
standardization. It was recommended to establish a  framework, that is, a
documented list of requirements, allowing ISO certification of various 
existing models, including the current candidate model as a working example.
Although such  approach makes more difficult the further project elaboration
and changes the work plans the MSU working group is ready to discuss it within
ISO standard procedure involving the IAGA Division V and Working Group 3
representatives and based on the new and previously  obtained reports of the
experts. MSU working group agrees with the comments regarding  the new model
checking on the real data and ready to present paraboloid model for the
independent testing and cross comparing with the other candidate models (if
any). However, this  activity must be carried out within the existing already
Project timetable  accepted and approved by ISO TC20/SC14/WG4 and without the
destroying the existing ISO procedure of the Standard development.
-->
<p>
  IAGA recommends that standard be formulated as a
   “set of specifications”
