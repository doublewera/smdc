1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Background</h3>

<p>
   The proposed ISO standard is a magnetic field model of the Earth's
magnetosphere. It is intended  to calculate the magnetic induction field
generated from a variety of current systems located on the  boundaries and
within the boundaries of the Earth's magnetosphere under a wide range of 
environmental conditions, quiet and disturbed, affected by Solar-Terrestrial
interactions simulated by Solar activity such  as Solar Flares and related
phenomena which induce terrestrial magnetic disturbances such as  Magnetic
Storms. 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.1">
1.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Purposes and scope</h3>

<p>
The goals of standardization of the Earth's magnetospheric magnetic
field are:

<ul><p>
<li> providing the unambiguous presentation of the geomagnetic field of
currents flowing inside the Earth and the magnetic field of magnetospheric
currents;</li>
<p>
<li> providing comparability of results of interpretation and
analysis of space experiments;</li>
<p>
<li> providing less labour-consuming character of calculations of
the magnetic field of magnetospheric currents in the space at
geocentric distances of 1-6.6 Earth's radii (R<sub>E</sub>);</li>
<p>
<li> providing the most reliable calculations of all elements of
the geomagnetic field in the space environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The main purposes of elaboration of the "Model of the Earth's
Magnetospheric Magnetic Field" Standard are

<p>

<ul><p>
<li> standardization of method of presentation of the magnetospheric 
magnetic field as a sum of magnetic fields 
induced by large-scale magnetospheric current systems;</li>
<p>
<li> standardization of the set of physical parameters of 
magnetospheric current systems ("key model parameters");</li>
<p>
<li> standardization of the methods of magnetospheric magnetic field 
calculations by temporal variations of the magnetospheric current systems 
parameters;</li>
<p>
<li> elaboration of the quantitative model of  the Earth's
Magnetospheric Magnetic Field dependent on physical parameters.</li>
</ul>  

<p>
Technique of calculation of the main parameters of the magnetospheric model
  using data of measurements in the Earth's environment is not the subject of
  standardization.

<p>
The model elaborated in the framework of standard will work in

<ul><p>
<li> Data Analyzing</li>
<p>
<li> Watching the space environment conditions</li>
<p>
<li> Forecasting the space environment conditions</li>
<p>
<li> Warning the expected extremal conditions</li>
<p>
<li> Postcasting and case study</li>
</ul>  

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.2">
1.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Identification of users</h3>

<p>
The model will be useful for user communities working with applications
in Space Weather Forecasting, human health  radiation hazards determination,
the estimation of spacecraft and electronic devices integrity, and in  pure and
applied space physics environmental research.

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.3">
1.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Users requirements</h3>

<p>
The ultimate objective of space weather research is the development of
quantitative forecasting models. The main requirements of the Space Weather
community to magnetospheric model are

<p>

<ul><p>
<li> Model reliability:

<p>

<ol type="1"><p>
<li>  the model of the magnetospheric currents  magnetic
field must describe a regular part of the magnetic field, its dependence on the
interplanetary medium parameters and reflects such magnetospheric magnetic
field features as depression of the Earth's magnetosphere on the dayside due to
its interaction with the solar wind, day and seasonal variations of the
magnetic field;</li>
<p>
<li>  the model takes into account the tilt angle between the geomagnetic
   dipole and plane orthogonal to the Earth-Sun line varying within
   a range from -35 to +35 degrees;</li>
<p>
<li> the model describes dynamics of the magnetospheric large-scale
   current systems;</li>
<p>
<li>  the model takes into account the dependence of the magnetic field of the
   magnetospheric current systems  on the conditions in the
   Earth's environment;</li>
<p>
<li> the model enables description of the magnetosphere under
   disturbed conditions, without restrictions imposed on the values
   of interplanetary medium parameters;</li>
<p>
<li>  the model enables taking into account variations of the magnetopause form and
location as well as IMF penetration into the magnetosphere in dependence on
solar wind conditions.</li>
</ol></li>
<p>
<li>  Algorithm simplicity allowing the real-time (near real-time)
calculations.</li>
<p>
<li>  The model must be based on closed set of mathematical equations derived
from well founded physical principles.</li>
</ul> 

<p>
     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.4">
1.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Specification of the usefulness of the proposed standard</h3> 

<p>
The model is used for instance to harden both spacecraft and the sensitive
electronic devices carried  by them from the effects of high-energy cosmic
radiation. Space Weather Forecasting has value to  the electrical utility
community which can loose of millions of dollars in equipment such as 
transformers and in downtime due to magnetic storm induction effects at the
Earth's surface. For  example, during the March 1989 magnetic storm the Quebec
Hydroelectric Utility grid failed  costing on the order of 8600 million. Other
utility grids around the world were also adversely  affected by this storm.
Transcontinental oil and gas pipelines are also susceptible to  electromagnetic
induction due to Space Weather, which causes corrosion and high-voltage
hazards.  Similar problems occur with spacecraft such as communications and
weather satellites. These  satellites are often in geostationary orbits. During
a magnetic storm, the magnetospheric boundary,  called the magnetopause, which
ordinary acts as a deflecting shield against the Solar Wind is  compressed
inside the orbits of these satellites, leaving them exposed to the full impact
of the Solar  Wind's radiation. Often the orientation of the satellites is
determined by sensing the geomagnetic  field. During a magnetic storm, when the
magnetopause is compressed inside a satellite's orbit, the  magnetic field
orientation is suddenly reversed causing the satellite to abruptly rotate,
which inturn  causes extended booms (e.g. gravity gradient stabilization booms
and others carrying electronic  sensors) to snap off, leaving the satellite
dysfunctional. The strong increase of the relativistic electron fluxes  in the
inner magnetosphere during magnetic storm main and recovery phases is the
factor which can also be responsible for the satellite dysfunction and even
losses. With sufficient warning through Space  Weather forecasting, such damage
can be minimized or eliminated.

<p>
Noting that over the past century the degree of Solar activity in terms of the
number of sunspots  occurring during the maximum of the 11-year Solar Cycle has
generally been increasing from one  cycle to the next, with some exceptions,
and noting that the Earth's dipole magnetic field strength,  which accounts for
approximately 90% of the Earth's total magnetic field, is currently
decreasing  by approximately 7.14% per century, and further noting that
Earth's dipole field strength has  decreased by 50% in the passed 2000 years,
it is clear that the degree of penetration of energetic  cosmic radiation to
lower altitudes is correspondingly increasing. This in turn heats the upper 
atmosphere, which eventually affects the lower atmosphere and subsequently the
daily weather and  storm patterns at Earth's surface as well as posing human
health hazards such as increased cancer  risk due to increased radiation at the
Earth's surface. The more energy penetrating into the Earth's  atmosphere, the
more active atmospheric weather patterns tend to be and the more severe are the
solar  related health hazards likely to be. These facts, plus our increased use
of the space environment,  mean substantially increased hazards related to
Space Weather over the next century. Knowledge  through modeling of the
magnetospheric environment and the resulting ability to predict its behavior 
are therefore becoming critical from the points of view of space mission
accomplishment, health,  economics, and natural disaster mitigation. Space
Weather is clearly a global phenomenon, for  which it is desirable to have an
internationally accepted magnetospheric model.

     <h3><a name="tth_sEc1.5">
1.5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Short review of relevant existing models</h3> 

<p>
At present a lot of the models are used to calculate the magnetic field in the
magnetosphere. The empirical models based on averaging of spacecraft
experimental data (the  OP-74, MF-73, T-87, T-89 models) allowing the real-time
calculations and satisfactory describe the main magnetospheric magnetic field
features during quite times but can not represent the magnetic field dynamics
especially during disturbances. Their parameters are often non-physical and can
not be changed according to magnetospheric conditions.  

<p>
Version of the Tsyganenko model, T96 [<i>Tsyganenko</i>, 1995], uses
the observed values of Dst, Bz<sub><span class="roman">IMF</span></sub>, and the solar wind dynamic
pressure to parameterize the intensity of the magnetospheric current systems.
In the T96 model these parameters are replaced with the Kp index which has
been used in the earlier versions of the Tsyganenko models.  The T96   (as the
earlier Tsyganenko models)  was constructed using the minimization of the
deviation from a data set of the magnetospheric magnetic field measurements
gathered by several spacecrafts during many years. The disturbed periods are
relatively rare events during the observation time, so their influence on the
model coefficients is negligibly small. That is why the T96 model's
applicability is limited by Dst, Bz<sub><span class="roman">IMF</span></sub>, and the solar wind
dynamic pressure low values.

<p>
So-called dynamical models are based on mathematical equations derived from
physical lows and allow calculations of magnetospheric magnetic field for any
level of disturbance. The investigation of the magnetospheric current
systems during magnetic storm is possible in terms of the modern dynamic
models of the magnetospheric magnetic field (OP-88, HV-95, A96). An important
advantage of the paraboloid model A96 [<i>Alexeev et al.</i>, 1996] is that it can
describe the magnetic field of each magnetospheric current system as a function
of its own time-dependent input parameters.  A functional dependence of the
model input parameters on the empirical data obtained by the satellites and
on-ground observatories is determined by a set of submodels. The term
``submodel'' is used for the analytical definition of each model input 
parameter as a function of the empirical data.
