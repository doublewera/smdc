 <b>A2. Nonstationary Case. Case study for January 9-12, 1997</b>

<p>
The dynamics of the magnetospheric current systems was studied in [<i>Alexeev
et al.,</i> 2001] in terms of A99 model for 
the specific magnetospheric disturbance on January 9-12, 1997 caused by the
interaction of the Earth's magnetosphere with a dense  solar wind plasma
cloud.  A dense cloud of the solar wind plasma was of rather complicated
structure.  A southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in its leading part
caused a significant substorm activity during the interaction with the
magnetosphere. A strong increase of the relativistic electron fluxes at the
geosynchronous orbit was observed [<i>Reeves et al.,</i> 1998]. The trailing
half of the magnetic cloud contained a strong northward IMF and was accompanied
by a large density enhancement that strongly compressed the magnetosphere.
Because of the significant compression of the magnetosphere, several
magnetopause crossings by the geostationary orbit took place. This storm  causes
also the crash of geostationary satellite Telstar 401 leading to significant
financial losses.

To investigate the Dst sources during the January 9-12, 1997, event the
ground magnetic field was analyzed  in terms of the paraboloid model of the
magnetosphere A99, which allows us to distinguish the contributions of
different large-scale current systems. The paraboloid model calculations are
demonstrated in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F4">13</a> at the left panel. The magnetospheric
magnetic field  variation is calculated at the geomagnetic equator at each hour
of  magnetic local time (MLT) and averaged over the equator.
Figures&nbsp;<a href="#F4">13</a>a-<a href="#F4">13</a>c (left panel) present the Dst sources Bcf,
Br, and Bt  and their parts arising owing to the Earth currents. 
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F4">13</a>d compares the Dst  and the calculated magnetic field. A
good agreement is obtained for both the relatively quiet and disturbed periods.
The calculations in terms of the paraboloid model give an RMS deviation from

<p>
We can see from the analysis of magnetic storm on
January 9-12, 1997, that the magnetospheric dynamics depends on all the 
magnetospheric magnetic field sources, which appear to be comparable by the
order of magnitude. The paraboloid model can be successfully applied, 
especially in the disturbed periods, when the empirical models are often not
valid.

<p>
The same magnetic storm was investigated by [Turner et al., 2000] in terms of
T96 model. The important feature of the T96 model is (as reported by the author
in the T96_01 model's description) its applicability only for 20&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="roman">nT</span> &gt; &nbsp;Dst&nbsp; &gt; <font face="symbol">-</font
>100&nbsp;nT, 0.5&nbsp;nPa &lt; p<sub>sw</sub> &lt; 10&nbsp;nPa, and
<font face="symbol">-</font
>10&nbsp;nT &lt; Bz<sub>IMF</sub> &lt; 10&nbsp;nT. In the course of the storm under consideration
(January 9-12, 1997) the upper value of p<sub>sw</sub> is significantly beyond the
10&nbsp;nPa limit. During the most disturbed interval of the magnetic storm under
consideration (the first hours of 11 January 1997) T96 model was out of order
(see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F4">13</a>, right panel).

<p>
The Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F4">13</a> right panel represents calculations made by T96 model
in [Turner et al., 2000].
The reason for the residual difference between the calculations presented in 
[<i>Alexeev et al.</i>, 2001] and those made by <i>Turner et al.</i> [2000] was
investigated in [<i>Alexeev et al.</i>, 2001]. This is the tail current inner
edge dynamics which are taken into account in the paraboloid model in
accordance with the auroral oval expansion due to the substorm activity. In the
calculations made by <i>Turner et al.</i> [2000] the dynamics of the inner edge
of the tail current sheet are neglected.

<p>
Thus the discrepancy of the results obtained in [<i>Alexeev et al.</i>, 2001]
and in that of <i>Turner et al.</i> [2000] is explained mainly by the use of
different quantitative models and associated with the difference of the tail
current parameterization. The quality of a model and its flexibility are
defined by the possibility of reflecting the dynamics of the large-scale
current systems. The empirical models do not yet allow one to determine
correctly the time dependence of each large-scale current system. In the
paraboloid model the submodels are used for the calculation of the parameters
of the large-scale magnetospheric current systems. These submodels can take
into account the significant features of various magnetospheric current
systems.

<p>
The analysis of the magnetic disturbances during the January 9-12, 1997,
event shows that in the course of the main phase of the magnetic storm the
contribution of the ring current, the currents on the magnetopause, and the
currents in the magnetotail are approximately equal to each other by an order
of magnitude. Nevertheless, in some periods one of the current systems becomes
dominant.  For example, an intense Dst positive enhancement (up to +50&nbsp;nT) in
the course of the magnetic storm recovery phase in the first hours on January
11, 1997, is associated with a significant increase of the currents on the
magnetopause, while the ring current and the magnetotail current remain at a
quiet level. Such analysis can be made only in terms of the modern dynamical
models such us   paraboloid models, where the different magnetic field sources
can be calculated separately. A comparison of the calculated Dst variation
with measurements indicates  good agreement. 

<p>
This analysis allows us to investigate the level of applicability of the
different kinds of  magnetospheric models.  The T96 model is not applicable for
disturbed periods and does not take into account the time dependence of the
important parameters of the magnetospheric current systems. For this reason the
most essential part of the magnetotail current system was excluded from the
consideration made by <i>Turner et al.</i> [2000]. The paraboloid model depends
on the parameters of magnetospheric origin and takes into account the movements
of the magnetotail in accordance with the level of geomagnetic activity. 

<p>
To estimate the accuracy of  our model calculations of the magnetospheric field
at geosynchronous orbit, a comparison with the data obtained on board  the
geostationary satellites GOES 8 and 9 was performed.  For the verification
of calculations of the magnetotail current contribution to Dst, the
obtained values of the model parameters were used to calculate the auroral
oval boundaries,  which were  compared  to the  boundaries obtained using
the DMSP precipitation data and the Polar UVI images.

<p>
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F3">14</a>a compares the polar cap radius calculated by 
paraboloid model to the radii obtained from the observations on  board 
DMSP F10-F13  and on  board  Polar. Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F3">14</a>a
shows  good agreement between the calculations and the experimental
data obtained from the independent sources. So, the model estimation of
<font face="symbol">F</font
><sub><font face="symbol">¥</font
></sub> can be used to identify the polar cap boundaries.
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F3">14</a>b compares the midnight latitude of the equatorward
boundary of the auroral oval calculated by paraboloid model to those 
determined using the particle spectra measured
on  board  the DMSP F10-F13 satellites.  The
obtained agreement with observations confirms our suggestions about
<font face="symbol">F</font

<p>
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F6">15</a> presents the calculations of the magnetic field along the GOES
9 and 8 spacecraft orbits. To take into account the magnetic field of the
interterrestrial sources,  the International Geomagnetic Reference
Field (IGRF95) model was used.  The agreement of calculations with the measured magnetic
field confirms the initial assumptions of the relative roles of the
magnetospheric current systems in the course of magnetic storm.

<p>
The usage of the paraboloid model allows one to make an important physical
conclusions about the development of the different magnetospheric magnetic
field sources during disturbances. We can see that during the main phase of a
weak magnetic storm the magnetotail current and the ring current create
disturbances of approximately equal intensities.  
The paraboloid model describes well the magnetic field variations on the
Earth's surface and at the geosynchronous orbit during the interaction
of a solar wind plasma cloud with the magnetosphere on January 9-12,
1997. The root mean square deviation between the model calculations 
and the measured field is equal to 8.7&nbsp;nT. The tail current contribution
to the storm maximum disturbance is about <font face="symbol">-</font
>60&nbsp;nT (for the Dst maximum equal
to <font face="symbol">-</font
>78&nbsp;nT).
