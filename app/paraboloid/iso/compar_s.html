The comparison with the Large Magnetosphere Magnetic Field Data Base
(Faierfield et al., Journal of Geophysical Research, V.99, p.11319-11326, 1994)
was made. Data base includes data of Explorer 33,35, IMPs 4,5,6,7,8, Heos 1,2
and ISEE 1, 2 in the region between 4 and 60  R<sub>E</sub> . Calculations of the
input parameters of the model were performed using solar wind data,  D<sub>st</sub> and  AL  indices which are contained in Data Base. Parameters  <font face="symbol">y</font

Appendix 1 of Working Draft. Field-aligned currents magnetic field was not taken
into account in these calculations as the first step of the model evaluation.

about +3% (the distribution is asymmetric with a long negative

The magnetic field module distributions in the different cells of the
magnetosphere, measured and calculated by paraboloid model are represented in
the Figure 3. The measured magnetic field has also an own non-Gaussian
distribution in each cell. The mean values and discrepancies represented in the
Fig. 2 are the measured magnetic field distribution mean values and mean
discrepancies between measured and calculated values. The calculated by
paraboloid model magnetic field is distributed in a good agreement with
observations.

currents effect which is not taken into account in these calculations. The
quite good agreement exists in the third cell.

Paraboloid model allows flexible taking into account the new magnetospheric
magnetic field sources. Moreover, because each magnetospheric magnetic field 
source with its own screening currents is calculated separately and depends
linearly on its own input parameters we can change the parametrization of
current systems to match better the data. To take into account the mentioned
above effects of field aligned currents and "thin" tail current the new "beta"
version of paraboloid model (A01) was developed.  The "thin geotail" magnetic
field [<i>Alexeev and Bobrovnikov, 1997</i>] and field aligned current magnetic
field [<i>Alexeev, Belenkaya and Clauer, 2001</i>] were taken into account. Fig. 6 shows
the measured magnetic field module mean values in the different cells of the
magnetosphere as well as mean discrepancies between the measured magnetic field
and calculated by A01 (second row) and T96 (third row). The more good agreement
for A01 is detected in the near-Earth region than that represented in the
Figure 2. We can see that in general, the obtained in terms of A01/A99
discrepancies are of the same order as those obtained in the framework of T96
model [<i>Tsyganenko,</i> 1995].

The magnetic field module distributions in the different cells of the
magnetosphere, measured and calculated by paraboloid model are represented in
the Figure 7. The magnetic field distributions measured in the near-Earth's
cells represented in the Figures 8 (magnetic field module) and 9 (Bx
component). The distributions of the magnetic field calculated for the
different parametrizations of the tail current and field aligned currents
demonstrate the more good agreement with experimental data than that obtained
in the framework of A99 paraboloid model.

<p>
The results represented on the Fig. 6 shows that paraboloid model, analytical
and based on the small number of the input parameters, describes the large
array of experimental data with approximately the same accuracy as the T96
model, which constructed as approximation of that array by the chosen by author
functions with the chosen number of parameters. Fig. 10  represents the
distributions of measured and calculated by A99 and T96 models magnetic fields
(module and Bx component, respectively).

In the Table 1 the comparison of magnetic field calculated by paraboloid model
(A99) Tsyganenko model (T96) and measured magnetic field from Large
Magnetosphere Magnetic Field Data Base averaged by the levels of disturbances
is presented. We can see that only for very quite conditions T96 model gives
the better results than A99. For  Kp  between  1<sup><font face="symbol">-</font
></sup>  and  2<sup><font face="symbol">-</font
></sup> 
the results are comparable, but for disturbed conditions ( Kp &gt; 2 ) A99 gives
the better results than T96. The T96 (as the earlier Tsyganenko models)  was 
constructed using the minimization of the deviation from a data set of  the
magnetospheric magnetic field measurements gathered by several spacecrafts
during many years. The disturbed periods are relatively rare events during the
observation time, so their influence on the  model coefficients is negligibly
small. That is why the T96 model's  applicability is limited by Dst,Bz<sub><span class="roman">IMF</span></sub>, and the solar wind dynamic pressure low values.
