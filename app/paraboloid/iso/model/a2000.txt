                      THE EARTH'S MAGNETOSPHERE

Dynamic paraboloid model (A2000) allows to calculate the variations of
magnetic field of each magnetospheric large scale current systems by
empirical data during quite and disturbed periods. A simple submodels
are used to calculate the A2000 paraboloid model input parameters via
empirical data. The possibilities to "switch on" and "switch off"
separate sources of the magnetospheric magnetic field are not provided
in this version. The IMF penetrated into the magnetosphere as well as
field-aligned currents magnetic field are included  in the total
magnetospheric magnetic field.

3. MODEL LIMITATIONS and PECULARITIES

 1. Because of the paraboloid coordinates singularity, avoid
    the magnetic field calculations at the Ox axis and magnetic field
    line calculations on the y=0 plane.
 2. The magnetic fields of Region 2 field-aligned currents and partial 
    ring current are not yet taken into account.
 3. Despite taking into account the IMF penetrated inside the
    magnetsphere, the magnetosheath magnetic field is not
    considered. 
 4. You can change submodels in A2000 to calculate input parameters
    on your own manner.

4. HOW TO CHANGE SUBMODELS?

The magnetospheric model parameters are calculated from a set of data
measured in the Earth's environment. The necessary set of data  should
include data on the solar wind and IMF, as well as the values 
characterizing a disturbed magnetosphere. The relationships between 
the model parameters and experimental data are described by submodels.
Calculation techniques for the model parameters are presented in the
subroutine SUBMOD. The submodels presented enable calculation of the
parameters of the  magnetospheric current systems and, consequently,
the  magnetospheric dynamics with known parameters of the solar wind,
the total energy of ring current particles, the polar oval dimensions
and AL-index of auroral perturbation. 

 1. Take the subroutine SUBMOD. You can find the commented blocks
    for all the model input parameters.
 2. Replace the needed block.
 3. Relace SUBMOD in the model with the new SUBMOD.
 4. ATTENTION: YOU CAN DO IT ONLY ON YOUR OWN RISK!

5. FIXED BUGS and SMALL PROGRAM CORRECTIONS

 1. 19 June 2002. The error in Fortran codes arising during calculations in 
    the near vicinity of OX axis was found and fixed.
 2. 27 June 2002. The default value for the ring current maximum location
    was chosen to be equal to 4 Re.
 3. 8 July 2002. Inaccurate description of PAR(5) parameter was corrected
    in program comments and in this file (a2000.txt) as well.
