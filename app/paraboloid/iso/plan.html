<b>Plan of Action</b>

<p align=justify>

A draft ISO standard has been proposed by I. I. Alexeev et al. of Moscow State
University's  Nuclear Physics Institute and now registered as ISO Working
Draft No 22009. However, this model is only one of several models in
current-use within  the space physics community. Each model has its proponents.
In order that the best overall model be standardized and in order to insure
that model achieves wide acceptance within the  scientific community, 
the evaluation of the Paraboloid
model, as well as any  other candidate standard magnetospheric model will be
continued in association with IAGA WG3 and Division V.

<p>
<br /> <h3><a name="tth_sEc6">
6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Preliminary Work Plan</h3>

<p>

<ul><p>
<li> Define more precisely the model input parameters and
   techniques of their determination from measurement data.</li>
<p>
<li> Work out the interfaces of programs which
   would enable utilization of the resources of space physics
   data bases.</li>
<p>
<li> Elaborate a family of models which allow calculations of
   the magnetic field in the magnetosphere, in the case of
   lacking measurement data for several of necessary model
   parameters (with somewhat decreased accuracy).</li>
<p>
<li> Estimate an accuracy of the model and compare the latter
   with other available models.</li>
<p>
<li> Include in the model the magnetic field sources not taken into
account in the current version of the model presented in the
Working Draft (the magnetic field of
the field-aligned currents, etc.)</li>
<p>
<li> To continue the evaluation and cross-comparison of the models available
as well as model testing, verification and code validation.</li>
</ul>
