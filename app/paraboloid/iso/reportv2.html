<b>1. Background</b>
<p>
   The proposed ISO standard is a magnetic field model of the Earth's
magnetosphere. It is intended  to calculate the magnetic induction field
generated from a variety of current systems located on the  boundaries and
within the boundaries of the Earth's magnetosphere under a wide range of 
environmental conditions, quiet and disturbed, affected by Solar-Terrestrial
interactions simulated by Solar activity such  as Solar Flares and related
phenomena which induce terrestrial magnetic disturbances such as  Magnetic
Storms. The model has applications in Space Weather Forecasting, human health 
radiation hazards determination, the estimation of spacecraft and electronic
devices integrity, and in  pure and applied space physics environmental
research.

<p>
The model is used for instance to harden both spacecraft and the sensitive
electronic devices carried  by them from the effects of high-energy cosmic
radiation. Space Weather Forecasting has value to  the electrical utility
community which can loose of millions of dollars in equipment such as 
transformers and in downtime due to magnetic storm induction effects at the
Earth's surface. For  example, during the March 1989 magnetic storm the Quebec
Hydroelectric Utility grid failed  costing on the order of 8600 million. Other
utility grids around the world were also adversely  affected by this storm.
Transcontinental oil and gas pipelines are also susceptible to  electromagnetic
induction due to Space Weather, which causes corrosion and high-voltage
hazards.  Similar problems occur with spacecraft such as communications and
weather satellites. These  satellites are often in geostationary orbits. During
a magnetic storm, the magnetospheric boundary,  called the magnetopause, which
ordinary acts as a deflecting shield against the Solar Wind is  compressed
inside the orbits of these satellites, leaving them exposed to the full impact
of the Solar  Wind's radiation. Often the orientation of the satellites is
determined by sensing the geomagnetic  field. During a magnetic storm, when the
magnetopause is compressed inside a satellite's orbit, the  magnetic field
orientation is suddenly reversed causing the satellite to abruptly rotate,
which inturn  causes extended booms (e.g. gravity gradient stabilization booms
and others carrying electronic  sensors) to snap off, leaving the satellite
dysfunctional. The strong increase of the relativistic electron fluxes  in the
inner magnetosphere during magnetic storm main and recovery phases is the
factor which can also be responsible for the satellite dysfunction and even
losses. With sufficient warning through Space  Weather forecasting, such damage
can be minimized or eliminated.

<p>
Noting that over the past century the degree of Solar activity in terms of the
number of sunspots  occurring during the maximum of the 11-year Solar Cycle has
generally been increasing from one  cycle to the next, with some exceptions,
and noting that the Earth's dipole magnetic field strength,  which accounts for
approximately 90% of the Earth's total magnetic field, is currently
decreasing  by approximately 7.14% per century, and further noting that
Earth's dipole field strength has  decreased by 50% in the passed 2000 years,
it is clear that the degree of penetration of energetic  cosmic radiation to
lower altitudes is correspondingly increasing. This in turn heats the upper 
atmosphere, which eventually affects the lower atmosphere and subsequently the
daily weather and  storm patterns at Earth's surface as well as posing human
health hazards such as increased cancer  risk due to increased radiation at the
Earth's surface. The more energy penetrating into the Earth's  atmosphere, the
more active atmospheric weather patterns tend to be and the more severe are the
solar  related health hazards likely to be. These facts, plus our increased use
of the space environment,  mean substantially increased hazards related to
Space Weather over the next century. Knowledge  through modeling of the
magnetospheric environment and the resulting ability to predict its behavior 
are therefore becoming critical from the points of view of space mission
accomplishment, health,  economics, and natural disaster mitigation. Space
Weather is clearly a global phenomenon, for  which it is desirable to have an
internationally accepted magnetospheric model.

<p>
<br /><br /><b>2. Model Requirements</b> 

<p>
The objective is to develop a magnetospheric model that accurately describes
the vector-magnetic  induction due to an assortment of magnetospheric currents
in the solar-magnetospheric coordinate  system, in the inner magnetosphere
including geostationary orbit, under the full range of solar and geomagnetic
activity in real-time, or near-real-time. In doing so, the model  should
include the following features: 

<p>

<ol type="1"><p>
<li>  day-side/night-side asymmetry (i.e., compression of the magnetosphere 
on the day-side and  extension on the night-side due
to the interaction of the Solar Wind)</li>
<p>
<li>   daily and season variations</li>
<p>
<li>   accounts for the geomagnetic dipole inclination (tilt angle)
relative to the plane orthogonal  to the Earth-Sun line within a range of 
<font face="symbol">-</font
>35<sup><font face="symbol">°</font
></sup> to +35<sup><font face="symbol">°</font
></sup></li>
<p>
<li>  a dependence on interplanetary medium parameters (model parametrization)</li>
<p>
<li> the close relation with the International
Geomagnetic  Reference Field (IGRF)</li>
<p>
<li>    computation of the magnetospheric induction field includes:

<ol type="a"><p>
<li>  the magnetic
field due to the Chapman-Ferraro currents on the magnetopause  screening the dipole
field</li>
<p>
<li>  the magnetic field due to the geotail current system magnetic field</li>
<p>
<li>   the
magnetic field due to the ring current</li>
<p>
<li>  the magnetic field due to Region 1
field-aligned currents and closure ionospheric currents</li>
<p>
<li>   the magnetic field due to the magnetopause currents
screening the ring current</li>
<p>
<li>   the magnetic field due to induced currents in the solid Earth
generated by external sources</li>
</ol></li>
<p>
<li>  model consists of a small set of physical input parameters, such
as:

<ol type="a"><p>
<li>   <font face="symbol">y</font
> - geomagnetic dipole tilt angle</li>
<p>
<li>  <b>R</b><sub><b>1</b></sub> - distance to the subsolar point of the
magnetosphere</li>
<p>
<li>   <b>R</b><sub><b>2</b></sub> - distance to the inner edge of the geotail current sheet</li>
<p>
<li>   <font face="symbol">F</font
><sub><font face="symbol">¥</font
></sub> -
the tail lobe magnetic flux</li>
<p>
<li>   <b>I</b><sub><font face="symbol">||</font
></sub> - the total strength of Region 1 field-aligned
currents</li>
<p>
<li> <b>b</b><sub><b>r</b></sub> - the ring current magnetic field at the Earth's center
</li>
</ol></li>
<p>
<li> the input
parameters depend on real-time, or near-real-time Empirical Data:

<ol type="a"><p>
<li> Solar Wind data</li>
<p>
<li> Auroral Oval size and location</li>
<p>
<li>  AL and Dst magnetic indices</li>
</ol></li>
<p>
<li>  the model characterizes the
magnetospheric magnetic field under both Solar Quiet and  Disturbed conditions,
without restrictions/limits  imposed on the values of interplanetary  medium
parameters</li>
<p>
<li> although in the framework of the proposed standard, the model is 
intended to be used inside the geostationary orbit it must be selfconsistently 
enable to provide calculations in the whole magnetosphere</li>
</ol>

<p>
<br /><br /><b>3. The Draft Model</b>

<p>
The proposed ISO draft magnetic field model of the magnetosphere is intended to
satisfy all of the  requirements set forth in section 2. Although this standard
is intended to characterize the inner magnetosphere, the model must also merge
smoothly into magnetic field generated in other regions  of Earth's environment
such as the core, the ionosphere, the distant tail, near-magnetopause regions
and interplanetary space. Therefore, the  International Geomagnetic Reference
Field (IGRF) model, which describes the magnetic field  generated by the
Earth's core and which is produced by International Association of
Geomagnetism  and Aeronomy (IAGA) and updated by IAGA every 5 years is included
as part of the proposed  magnetospheric model. The total magnetic field is
calculated as a sum:

<p>

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table align="center"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
 B=B<sub>int</sub>+B<sub>m</sub> </td></tr></table>
</td><td width="1%">(1)</td></tr></table>



<p>
A model of the magnetic field generated by field-aligned currents, which 
connect the magnetosphere to the ionosphere, is also included as part of the
magnetospheric model,  as is a model of the magnetosheath magnetic field which
takes into account the Interplanetary  Magnetic Field (IMF) penetration into
the magnetosphere. The model further includes a set of auxiliary physical
models that characterize the magnetic field associated with various current
systems on he  magnetopause and within the magnetosphere itself. These include
a model for the fields  generated by Chapman-Ferraro currents on the
magnetopause that screen the primarily dipole field  of the Earth characterized
by the IGRF model, a model characterizing fields generated by the  geomagnetic
tail current system, a model characterizing fields generated by the Ring
Current  system, and a model characterizing fields generated by those
magnetopause currents that screen  the Ring Current. The overall model is
referred to as the Paraboloid Model A99 (Alexeev 99, described most completely 
in [Alexeev et al., 1996; Alexeev and Feldstein, 2001]). In A99 magnetospheric
magnetic field induction B<sub>m</sub> is represented in the form:

<p>


<table align="center"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
 B<sub>m</sub>=B<sub>CFD</sub>(R<sub>1</sub>)+B<sub>T</sub>(R<sub>1</sub>,R<sub>2</sub>, <font face="symbol">F</font
><sub><font face="symbol">¥</font
></sub>)+B<sub>FAC</sub>(I<sub><font face="symbol">||</font
></sub>)+B<sub>R</sub>(b<sub>R</sub>)+B<sub>CFR</sub>
(R<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>R</sub>) </td></tr></table>




<p>
 where <br />B<sub>CFD</sub>   is the magnetic field of Chapman-Ferraro
currents on the magnetopause screening the dipole field; <br />B<sub>T</sub> is the
geotail current system magnetic field; <br />B<sub>FAC</sub>  is the field of Region 1
field-aligned currents; <br />B<sub>R</sub> is the ring current magnetic field;<br />
B<sub>CFR</sub> is  magnetic field of the magnetopause currents screening the RC.<br />

<p>
The model has as its set of input parameters those listed in section 2, item 6.
All the input  parameters depend on empirical data such as Solar Wind data
(which can be taken from the ACE or Wind satellites), Auroral  Oval data, and
the AL and Dst magnetic indices computed from various geomagnetic
observatories  scattered around the Earth's surface. The different Submodels
may be used to calculate the input parameters. The model user can choose his
own Submodel which describe some input parameter dynamics based on his own data
set. The model magnetic field sources depend on empirical data via input
parameters (model parametrization). Thus, the paraboloid Model consists of
three basic elements:  Empirical data, Input Parameters, and the Model itself.

<p>
Model is dynamic in the sense that it can function in real-time or near
real-time depending on the  availability of the empirical data. It functions
through the full range of geomagnetic activity, from  Solar Quiet conditions to
severe magnetic storm conditions, and in the whole magnetosphere. Other
magnetospheric models are commonly limited in their range of applicability with
respect to geomagnetic activity and/or by the region of applicability in space.

environment - Model of the Earth's magnetospheric magnetic field" has been
registered with the ISO Central Secretariat and given the number 22009.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<br /><br /><b>5. Plan of Action</b>

<p>
A draft ISO standard has been proposed by I. I. Alexeev et al. of Moscow State
University's  Nuclear Physics Institute and now registered as ISO Approved Work
Item (AWI) No 22009. However, this model is but one of several models in
current-use within  the space physics community. Each model has its proponents.
In order that the best overall model  be standardized and in order to insure
that that model achieves wide acceptance within the  scientific community, and
given that the international scientific expertise in the field of 
magnetospheric physic resides within IAGA, the evaluation of the Paraboloid
model, as well as any  other candidate standard magnetospheric model, be
evaluated by a special Working Group set up  for this explicit purpose within
IAGA. 
During  IAGA-IASPEI Joint Assembly  in Hanoi ( August 2001) it was approved that the
 evaluation of the
the ISO magnetospheric model is in the field of interest of the WG 3 of Division V of IAGA.
It was decided to create 
the scientific subcommittee of the Division V Working Group 3  of International Association
Geomagnetism and Aeronomy  for the examination of the ISO 
magnetospheric model. This activity must be joint with Division III and to take into account
a Internal Field Model (IGRF) and influence of the solar wind (Division IV) on the magnetospheric
model.

<p>
It is expected
that the  subcommittee will deliberate on this matter between one and two
years. IAGA meets once every  two years. Thus at the next full IAGA meeting,
the working group will have performed its function,  which can result in one of
several possible outcomes: 

<p>
1) The  subcommittee could decide that the state of
the art of magnetospheric modeling is such that  an international standard is
not warranted at this time. 

<p>
2) The paraboloid model of Igor Alexeev and
associates may be adopted as the standard. 

<p>
3) Some part of other candidate model
proposed by the working group may be used in paraboloid model. 

<p>
4) The subcommittee may
synthesize a standard magnetospheric model by taking the best of each  of the
proposed candidate models. 

<p>
5) The subcommittee may, using the candidate models
and the criteria listed in section 2 as a  guide, create a completely new
magnetospheric model and adopt it as the standard.

The magnetic field module distributions in the different cells of the
magnetosphere, measured and calculated by paraboloid model are represented in
the Figure 3. The measured magnetic field has also an own non-Gaussian
distribution in each cell. The mean values and discrepancies represented in the
Fig. 2 are the measured magnetic field distribution mean values and mean
discrepancies between measured and calculated values. The calculated by
paraboloid model magnetic field is distributed in a good agreement with
observations.

Paraboloid model allows flexible taking into account the new magnetospheric
magnetic field sources. Moreover, because each magnetospheric magnetic field 
source with its own screening currents is calculated separately and depends
linearly on its own input parameters we can change the parametrization of
current systems to match better the data. To take into account the mentioned
above effects of field aligned currents and "thin" tail current the new "beta"
version of paraboloid model (A01) was developed.  The "thin geotail" magnetic
field [<i>Alexeev and Bobrovnikov, 1997</i>] and field aligned current magnetic
field [<i>Alexeev, Belenkaya and Clauer, 2001</i>] were taken into account. Fig. 6 shows
the measured magnetic field module mean values in the different cells of the
magnetosphere as well as mean discrepancies between the measured magnetic field
and calculated by A01 (second row) and T96 (third row). The more good agreement
for A01 is detected in the near-Earth region than that represented in the
Figure 2. We can see that in general, the obtained in terms of A01/A99
discrepancies are of the same order as those obtained in the framework of T96
model [<i>Tsyganenko,</i> 1995].

The magnetic field module distributions in the different cells of the

the Figure 7. The magnetic field distributions measured in the near-Earth's
cells represented in the Figures 8 (magnetic field module) and 9 (Bx

different parametrizations of the tail current and field aligned currents
demonstrate the more good agreement with experimental data than that obtained
in the framework of A99 paraboloid model.

<p>
The results represented on the Fig. 6 shows that paraboloid model, analytical
and based on the small number of the input parameters, describes the large
array of experimental data with approximately the same accuracy as the T96
model, which constructed as approximation of that array by the chosen by author
functions with the chosen number of parameters. Fig. 10  represents the

the results are comparable, but for disturbed conditions ( Kp &gt; 2 ) A99 gives

constructed using the minimization of the deviation from a data set of  the
magnetospheric magnetic field measurements gathered by several spacecrafts
during many years. The disturbed periods are relatively rare events during the
observation time, so their influence on the  model coefficients is negligibly
small. That is why the T96 model's  applicability is limited by Dst,Bz<sub><span class="roman">IMF</span></sub>, and the solar wind dynamic pressure low values.

 <b>A2. Nonstationary Case. Case study for January 9-12, 1997</b>

<p>
The dynamics of the magnetospheric current systems was studied in [<i>Alexeev
et al.,</i> 2001] in terms of A99 model for 
the specific magnetospheric disturbance on January 9-12, 1997 caused by the
interaction of the Earth's magnetosphere with a dense  solar wind plasma
cloud.  A dense cloud of the solar wind plasma was of rather complicated
structure.  A southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in its leading part
caused a significant substorm activity during the interaction with the
magnetosphere. A strong increase of the relativistic electron fluxes at the
geosynchronous orbit was observed [<i>Reeves et al.,</i> 1998]. The trailing
half of the magnetic cloud contained a strong northward IMF and was accompanied
by a large density enhancement that strongly compressed the magnetosphere.
Because of the significant compression of the magnetosphere, several
magnetopause crossings by the geostationary orbit took place. This storm  causes
also the crash of geostationary satellite Telstar 401 leading to significant
financial losses.

To investigate the Dst sources during the January 9-12, 1997, event the
ground magnetic field was analyzed  in terms of the paraboloid model of the
magnetosphere A99, which allows us to distinguish the contributions of
different large-scale current systems. The paraboloid model calculations are
demonstrated in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F4">13</a> at the left panel. The magnetospheric
magnetic field  variation is calculated at the geomagnetic equator at each hour
of  magnetic local time (MLT) and averaged over the equator.

<p>
We can see from the analysis of magnetic storm on
January 9-12, 1997, that the magnetospheric dynamics depends on all the 
magnetospheric magnetic field sources, which appear to be comparable by the
order of magnitude. The paraboloid model can be successfully applied, 
especially in the disturbed periods, when the empirical models are often not
valid.

<p>
The same magnetic storm was investigated by [Turner et al., 2000] in terms of
T96 model. The important feature of the T96 model is (as reported by the author
in the T96_01 model's description) its applicability only for 20&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="roman">nT</span> &gt; &nbsp;Dst&nbsp; &gt; <font face="symbol">-</font
>100&nbsp;nT, 0.5&nbsp;nPa &lt; p<sub>sw</sub> &lt; 10&nbsp;nPa, and
<font face="symbol">-</font
>10&nbsp;nT &lt; Bz<sub>IMF</sub> &lt; 10&nbsp;nT. In the course of the storm under consideration
(January 9-12, 1997) the upper value of p<sub>sw</sub> is significantly beyond the
10&nbsp;nPa limit. During the most disturbed interval of the magnetic storm under
consideration (the first hours of 11 January 1997) T96 model was out of order
(see Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F4">13</a>, right panel).

<p>
The Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F4">13</a> right panel represents calculations made by T96 model
in [Turner et al., 2000].
The reason for the residual difference between the calculations presented in 
[<i>Alexeev et al.</i>, 2001] and those made by <i>Turner et al.</i> [2000] was
investigated in [<i>Alexeev et al.</i>, 2001]. This is the tail current inner
edge dynamics which are taken into account in the paraboloid model in
accordance with the auroral oval expansion due to the substorm activity. In the
calculations made by <i>Turner et al.</i> [2000] the dynamics of the inner edge
of the tail current sheet are neglected.

<p>
Thus the discrepancy of the results obtained in [<i>Alexeev et al.</i>, 2001]
and in that of <i>Turner et al.</i> [2000] is explained mainly by the use of
different quantitative models and associated with the difference of the tail
current parameterization. The quality of a model and its flexibility are
defined by the possibility of reflecting the dynamics of the large-scale
current systems. The empirical models do not yet allow one to determine
correctly the time dependence of each large-scale current system. In the
paraboloid model the submodels are used for the calculation of the parameters
of the large-scale magnetospheric current systems. These submodels can take
into account the significant features of various magnetospheric current
systems.

<p>
The analysis of the magnetic disturbances during the January 9-12, 1997,
event shows that in the course of the main phase of the magnetic storm the
contribution of the ring current, the currents on the magnetopause, and the
currents in the magnetotail are approximately equal to each other by an order
of magnitude. Nevertheless, in some periods one of the current systems becomes
dominant.  For example, an intense Dst positive enhancement (up to +50&nbsp;nT) in
the course of the magnetic storm recovery phase in the first hours on January
11, 1997, is associated with a significant increase of the currents on the
magnetopause, while the ring current and the magnetotail current remain at a
quiet level. Such analysis can be made only in terms of the modern dynamical
models such us   paraboloid models, where the different magnetic field sources
can be calculated separately. A comparison of the calculated Dst variation
with measurements indicates  good agreement. 

<p>
This analysis allows us to investigate the level of applicability of the
different kinds of  magnetospheric models.  The T96 model is not applicable for
disturbed periods and does not take into account the time dependence of the
important parameters of the magnetospheric current systems. For this reason the
most essential part of the magnetotail current system was excluded from the
consideration made by <i>Turner et al.</i> [2000]. The paraboloid model depends
on the parameters of magnetospheric origin and takes into account the movements
of the magnetotail in accordance with the level of geomagnetic activity. 

<p>
To estimate the accuracy of  our model calculations of the magnetospheric field
at geosynchronous orbit, a comparison with the data obtained on board  the
geostationary satellites GOES 8 and 9 was performed.  For the verification
of calculations of the magnetotail current contribution to Dst, the
obtained values of the model parameters were used to calculate the auroral
oval boundaries,  which were  compared  to the  boundaries obtained using
the DMSP precipitation data and the Polar UVI images.

<p>
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F3">14</a>a compares the polar cap radius calculated by 
paraboloid model to the radii obtained from the observations on  board 
DMSP F10-F13  and on  board  Polar. Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F3">14</a>a
shows  good agreement between the calculations and the experimental
data obtained from the independent sources. So, the model estimation of
<font face="symbol">F</font
><sub><font face="symbol">¥</font
></sub> can be used to identify the polar cap boundaries.
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F3">14</a>b compares the midnight latitude of the equatorward
boundary of the auroral oval calculated by paraboloid model to those 
determined using the particle spectra measured
on  board  the DMSP F10-F13 satellites.  The
obtained agreement with observations confirms our suggestions about

<p>
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#F6">15</a> presents the calculations of the magnetic field along the GOES
9 and 8 spacecraft orbits. To take into account the magnetic field of the
interterrestrial sources,  the International Geomagnetic Reference
Field (IGRF95) model was used.  The agreement of calculations with the measured magnetic
field confirms the initial assumptions of the relative roles of the
magnetospheric current systems in the course of magnetic storm.

<p>
The usage of the paraboloid model allows one to make an important physical
conclusions about the development of the different magnetospheric magnetic
field sources during disturbances. We can see that during the main phase of a
weak magnetic storm the magnetotail current and the ring current create
disturbances of approximately equal intensities.  
The paraboloid model describes well the magnetic field variations on the
Earth's surface and at the geosynchronous orbit during the interaction
of a solar wind plasma cloud with the magnetosphere on January 9-12,
1997. The root mean square deviation between the model calculations 
and the measured field is equal to 8.7&nbsp;nT. The tail current contribution
to the storm maximum disturbance is about <font face="symbol">-</font
>60&nbsp;nT (for the Dst maximum equal
to <font face="symbol">-</font
>78&nbsp;nT).
