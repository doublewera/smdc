<p align="justify">
Space monitoring data center of MSU (SMDC) provides a unified interface for
data retrieval, visualization and analysis, as well as development and
testing of new models. Space monitoring data center collects data on
the radiation conditions in the Earth&#39;s environment measured by Russian
spacecrafts (Coronas-I, Coronas-F, Meteor-3M, Mir Orbital Station, Tatyana)
during approximately the last 20 years.

The main goal of SMDC is to unite all the data of space experiments performed
by Scobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics into a single online information
system. The interactive services provide access to databases of energetic
particle fluxes, X-ray and gamma fluxes, magnetospheric plasma and magnetic
field parameters. The current space experiments performed by SINP are
performed by Electron-Pesca device onboard Coronas-Photon satellite
and by DUFIK device onboard Tatyana-2 satellite. The data on particle
fluxes and UV/IR atmospheric luminosity measured along spacecraft orbits
are published on SMDC portal in the near-real time.

The ultimate objective of SMDC is to build reliable forecast of key
magnetospheric parameters and analysis of current geophysical and radiation
—Åonditions in the near-Earth space. The real-time data are involved to provide
fast and reliable analysis of radiation and geomagnetic conditions in the near-Earth
space. The particle fluxes measurements allow to control the radiation
conditions in the Earth&#39;s space environment: radiation belts location
and intensity, as well as SEP penetration boundaries if any. Existing
service calculates in real time the magnetopause stand-off distance,
using data on interplanetary magnetic field solar wind dynamic pressure
measured by ACE spacecraft. It provides short-term forecast of magnetopause
location approximately 60 min prior solar wind approaching terrestrial
magnetosphere.
