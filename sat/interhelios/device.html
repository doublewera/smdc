<h4>"INTERSONG" device allows to detect:</h4>

<ul><li>neutrons ( 0.01 - 5 MeV, 20 - 100 MeV )
</li><li>x-ray radiation ( 0.03 - 0.1 MeV )
</li><li>gamma - rays of the energy range from 0.1 MeV to 20 MeV to cover lines from major constituents of solar atmosphere
</li></ul>

<h4>"SKI-5" device allows to detect:</h4>

<ul><li>protons ( 1.6 - 24 MeV, 80 - 200 MeV )
</li><li>electrons ( 0,04 - 2,5 MeV )
</li><li>ions, including alpha - particles, ( from 2.5 MeV / nucl to 120 MeV / nucl )
</li></ul>

<h4>The instrumental suite consists of three blocks:</h4>

<ul><li>"INTERSONG" was developed to detect neutral radiation produced during a solar flare and serves for registration of neutrons, x-ray and gamma - ray radiation
</li><li>The block of detecting of a charged particles "SKI-5-D" - serves for registration of the electrons, protons and ions
</li><li>The electronics unit "SKI-5-E"- serves to collect the data, their storage and for a transmission of the data into telemetry system
</li></ul>

<p>
To detect neutral particles scintillation counter combined of 6LiI(Eu)
and plastic filled by 10B is proposed. 6LiI crystal 5 cm diameter by 2 cm 
thick is used to detect slowed in plastic scintillator neutrons with the 
energies 0.01-5.0 MeV and to measure spectra of gamma and X-rays in 
the energy range 0.03-10 MeV including that of gamma-lines. Plastic with 10B 
scintillator surrounds LiI in 4 pi. Its diameter is 7 cm and its thickness 
is 3 cm in front of LiI and 1 cm behind it.  Pulse shape discrimination is 
used to distinguish events in plastic and LiI. Delayed coincidences of pulses 
in plastic and LiI (and in plastic itself as well) give an opportunity to 
identify neutrons in the energy range 0.5-5.0 MeV and to measure their 
energies. Simultaneously it allow us to eliminate charged particles. Energy 
release about 4.6 MeV in LiI and 2.9 in plastic is considered as a sign of 
detection of slowed in plastic neutron with the initial energy &gt; 0.01 MeV.
Counting rates of such events are recorded too.</p>
	<p>In the LiI X-rays are detected in 3 energy intervals in the range 
0.03-0.10 MeV and other neutral particles - in 10 energy intervals in the 
range 0.1-100 MeV. In the 0.1-5 Mev range these particles are mainly gamma's,
in the 20-100 MeV range - mainly neutrons with the energies &gt; 20 MeV and in 
the 5-20 MeV range - both gamma's and neutrons. In the plastic scintillator 
energy of neutrons is measured in the energy range 0.5-5 MeV in 5 intervals. 
To identify gamma-lines 240-channel quasi-logarifmic analizer is used in the 
energy range 0.3-10 MeV.</p>
