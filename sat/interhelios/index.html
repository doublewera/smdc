   <p style="text-indent:25px" <FONT face="Arial"><B>INTERHELIO-Zond</B> project is being developed within the framework of the Federal Space Program of the Russian Federation</p>
   <p>It is aimed at the research of the Sun from close distances including inner heliosphere and solution of the problems of solar corona heating, acceleration of the solar wind, origin of the solar flares and coronal mass ejections.</p>


   <h4>Goal of SINP experiments</h4>
   <p>(THE "INTERSONG" AND THE "SKI-5" DEVICES- A PARTS OF  THE "INTERHELIO-Zond" SATELLITE):

   <p>The purposes of  the experiment:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Studying neutral component of solar flare radiations (neutrons, x-ray radiation and gamma-quantums) in the inner heliosphere, at the distances up to 60 solar radii from the sun</li>
    <li>Studying fluxes of an electrons, protons and ions from helium to iron in inner heliosphere</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Basic scientific problems:</h4>
    <ul><li>Determine the mechanisms of the solar corona heating and acceleration of the solar wind
    </li><li>Investigate thin structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere
    </li><li>Define the nature and global dynamics of the solar flares and coronal mass ejections and their influence on the heliosphere and space weather;
    </li><li>Explore the Sun as the powerful and changeable accelerator of the particles
    </li><li>Observe from high heliolatitude and to investigate the solar atmosphere and the corona in polar and equatorial regions
    </li></ul>

    <h4>Observations and in-situ measurements</h4>

    <p>The feature of the SC orbit will allow carry out the series of original observations and in-situ measurements important for the solution of the scientific problems:</p>
    <ul><li>Observations of the solar atmosphere with the high spatial resolution
    </li><li>Corotational observations and measurements
    </li><li>In-situ measurements near the Sun
    </li><li>Out-of ecliptic observations and measurements
    </li><li>Stereo observations of the Sun (in combination with others SC)
    </li><li>Observations of the far side of the Sun invisible from the Earth
    </li></ul>

    <h4>Scientific problems of the project:</h4>

    <p>Selected devices allow to investigate spectra, fluxes and maximal energy of the accelerated protons and ions based
    on the measured spectra of neutrons, and the ratio of the most intense gamma-ray lines. Simultaneous use of spectra
    of neutrons, x-ray and gamma-quamtums will allow to get much more precise estimations of fluxes, spectra and of a
    chemical composition of the acceleration site and of solar cosmic rays.</p>

    <p>Instruments selection allows to investigate structure, density and dynamics of above parameters at the depth of photosphere layers of the Sun.</p>

    <p>Instruments suite composed of INTERSONG and SKI-5 allows to track all set of the phenomena, since occurrence of
    non- thermal "tail" solar plasma electrons and down to acceleration of ions up to the highest energies. Explorations near
    to the Sun will allow to expand essentially on a class of investigated solar flares and to noticeably increase statistics.of
    studied flares</p>

    <p>Important to note that for the first time there will be an opportunity to register reliably neutrons near the Sun by the
    detector with imaging capabilities that will firmly establish solar origin of detected neutrons and to derive spectral
    distribution of neutrons in circumsolar space.</p>

    <h4>Time schedule:</h4>
    <p>Terms of realization of the project - 2010  - 2015 years</p>
