<p style="text-indent:15px" <FONT face="Arial">The data recived from <B>ACE</B> satellite. The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) is an Explorer mission that 
was managed by the Office of Space Science Mission and Payload Development Division 
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 
</p>
<p style="text-indent:15px" <FONT face="Arial"><B>ACE</B> launched on a McDonnell-Douglas Delta II 7920 launch vehicle on August 25, 1997 
from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
The spacecraft has enough propellant on board to maintain an orbit at L1 until ~2024.
</p>
<p style="text-indent:15px" <FONT face="Arial"><B>ACE</B> orbits the L1 libration point which is a point of Earth-Sun gravitational equilibrium about 
1.5 million km from Earth and 148.5 million km from the Sun. 
<p style="text-indent:15px" <FONT face="Arial"><B>ACE</B> provides near-real-time 24/7 continuous coverage of solar wind parameters 
and solar energetic particle intensities (space weather).
